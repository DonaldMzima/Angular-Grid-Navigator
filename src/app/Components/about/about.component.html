    blocks you would have to walk on the city grid to reach the destination.

    You are provided with a list of instructions to navigate on a grid to reach
    a destination. Start facing north, and then follow the provided sequence:
    either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given
    number of blocks, ending at a new intersection.
